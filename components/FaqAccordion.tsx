    q: 'How can 4BC Global help my business?',
    a: '4BC Global helps B2B and B2C enterprises make informed strategic decisions. We design custom quantitative and qualitative research studies — from market entry assessments and brand tracking to customer satisfaction programs and network planning.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What makes 4BC Global different from other research firms?',
    a: 'Our method-neutral approach means we diagnose your business challenge first, then design the right research methodology. Every engagement is led by a research director with 15+ years of MEA experience — so you get clarity at every step.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which geographies do you cover?',
    a: 'We operate where it matters most. With active research conducted across 40+ geographies, we bring ground-level intelligence and regional expertise to every engagement. Our teams travel directly to meet stakeholders and decision-makers wherever they are — driven by research requirements, business-critical needs, and situational awareness. We maintain strategic presence in Dubai (UAE), London (UK), with associate offices in Riyadh (KSA) and India, ensuring proximity to the markets we serve and the agility to deploy as demands evolve.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you handle large-scale research projects?',
    a: 'Yes. We have executed engagements involving 4,500+ quantitative interviews, 100+ expert IDIs, and 1,500+ GPS-mapped locations — all within single projects. Our network of field partners across MEA enables large-scale execution.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What research methodologies do you use?',
    a: 'We take pride in our method-neutral research approach — where methodology is entirely driven by research requirements. Our researchers are experts in both qualitative and quantitative methods, ensuring no silos: the same team delivers 360° market insight through a seamless blend. We blend quantitative surveys (CATI, online, face-to-face), qualitative in-depth interviews (IDIs), focus groups, mystery shopping, observation research, secondary desk research, and geo-mapping — choosing the right mix for each unique challenge.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you have proprietary research tools?',
    a: 'Yes. We have built three proprietary platforms: 4BC InFuse (secondary research intelligence), 4BC Landscape (geo-mapping and network planning), and 4BC ImpactIQ (socio-economic impact assessment framework).',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I get a proposal?',
    a: 'We offer a no-obligation 20-minute consultation with a senior researcher to understand your requirements. Many research and marketing challenges don\'t start with a written brief — and that\'s perfectly fine. This session allows us to conceptualize and clarify your needs before moving to proposal. Alternatively, if you have a written brief ready, use our Contact page to share your requirements, and we\'ll respond within 1–2 business days with an initial approach and proposal.',
