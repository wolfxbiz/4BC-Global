He has applied this across market entry strategy, B2B research, and government sector advisory, working with organisations ranging from multinationals to public sector institutions across MEA.\n\nThe practice grew because clients kept coming back — and sending others. Each engagement built on the last, deepening relationships and expanding the range of questions 4BC was trusted to answer.\n\nA researcher at heart, Sukhdev is as comfortable conducting an in-depth interview with a shopfloor worker as he is in a boardroom with a CEO. That breadth of human curiosity — and the discipline to listen without agenda — is what drives the quality of insight that clients rely on.',

                <p>
                  In 2007, a small focused team within Kantar MENA started doing something different. Not just conducting research — but establishing a new standard for what market intelligence could look like across the Middle East and Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the next thirteen years, that team became one of the most sought after teams at Kantar MENA. They advised global multinationals, regional conglomerates, and national governments across 40+ markets. They built a reputation for rigour, for listening deeply, and for delivering insight that actually changed decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, in 2020, the entire team made a deliberate choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They stepped out as one — people, clients, case studies, methodologies, expertise — and founded 4BC Global.
                </p>
                <p className="font-heading font-semibold text-text text-[18px]">
                  Not to start from scratch. But to evolve.

                  We carried our DNA forward. We left the limitations behind.
