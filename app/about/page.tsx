He has applied this across market entry strategy, B2B research, and government sector advisory, working with organisations ranging from multinationals to public sector institutions across MEA.\n\nThe practice grew because clients kept coming back — and sending others. Each engagement built on the last, deepening relationships and expanding the range of questions 4BC was trusted to answer.\n\nA researcher at heart, Sukhdev is as comfortable conducting an in-depth interview with a shopfloor worker as he is in a boardroom with a CEO. That breadth of human curiosity — and the discipline to listen without agenda — is what drives the quality of insight that clients rely on.',

                <p>
                  In 2007, a small focused team within Kantar MENA started doing something different. Not just conducting research — but establishing a new standard for what market intelligence could look like across the Middle East and Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the next thirteen years, that team became Kantar MENA's fastest-growing and most profitable research unit. They advised global multinationals, regional conglomerates, and national governments across 40+ markets. They built a reputation for rigour, for listening deeply, and for delivering insight that actually changed decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, in 2020, the entire team made a deliberate choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They stepped out as one — people, clients, case studies, methodologies, expertise — and founded 4BC Global.

                <p className="font-heading font-semibold text-text text-[18px]">

                  Demographic complexity varies dramatically — from expat-majority urban centres in the UAE and Qatar, to rapidly evolving local populations in Saudi Arabia, to deeply community-rooted markets across Africa. Published data is often scarce. Online panels frequently underdeliver. And the answers that matter most rarely surface in a spreadsheet.
